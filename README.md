## Lessons Learned

- Clear Project Goals: Taking time in the initial phase to clearly define project goals and expected outcomes proved invaluable. This ensured alignment within the team and provided a roadmap for development.

- Patience and Perseverance: Scraping data from multiple websites presented significant challenges, particularly with websites employing shadow_roots. Overcoming these obstacles required patience and perseverance, highlighting the importance of persistence in the face of adversity.

- Data Normalization: Implementing data normalization techniques facilitated the matching and integration of multiple datasets. This streamlined the data cleaning process and improved the efficiency of data analysis.

- Effective Project Management: Utilizing project management tools such as Kanban Boards helped maintain organization and increase productivity. Clear task prioritization and progress tracking ensured that the team remained focused and on schedule.

- Collaborative Coding: While dividing tasks can be effective, the project team found that pair coding proved advantageous in certain situations. Collaborative coding fostered knowledge sharing, problem-solving, and faster resolution of issues.

- Recommendation for Future Projects: For individuals embarking on similar projects, we recommend allocating sufficient time at the beginning to map out project objectives and establish a clear direction. Additionally, prioritizing patience, perseverance, and effective project management practices can greatly contribute to the success of the project.

By reflecting on these lessons learned, we aim to continually improve our approach to future projects and foster a culture of continuous learning and growth within our team.
